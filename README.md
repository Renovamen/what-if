# What if?

My messy notebook, built with [VuePress 2](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/). Maybe it is unsuitable for humans to read.

See this notebook here: [note.zxh.io](https://note.zxh.io/)

Formerly, it was built with:

- [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/): [[code]](https://github.com/Renovamen/what-if/tree/gridsome)
- [VuePress 1](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/): [[code]](https://github.com/Renovamen/what-if/tree/vuepress1)

## Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Serve with hot reload
yarn dev

# Build for production with minification
yarn build
```
